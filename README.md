# Brute Force Simulator

## Description
The **Brute Force Simulator** is a C++ program designed to demonstrate a brute-force attack simulation for password cracking. The user can input a target password and choose a character set for the attack. The simulator attempts to crack the password by generating combinations from the specified character set until it finds the correct password.

## Features
- Allows users to enter a target password.
- Provides options for different character sets:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Lowercase and uppercase letters (a-z, A-Z)
  - Letters and digits (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
  - Letters, digits, and special characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, !@#$%^&*)
- Displays each attempted password until the correct password is found.
- Counts and displays the number of attempts made to crack the password.
